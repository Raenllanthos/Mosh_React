-- Student's Question:
Most React courses out there teach React with Redux. Does this course cover Redux?


No! I have a separate course dedicated to Redux. But in order to take that course, first you need to properly learn React.

Redux is great and is used in more than half of React projects. But not every React project needs Redux. This is a common misconception.

So, focus on learning React for now. Once you finish this course, you can enroll in my Redux course to take your skills to the next level.
