00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're going to take a different approach to start this section. 

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Instead of me talking about a bunch of topics and then give you an exercise, we're going to

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
start with an exercise. So I want you to spend 15-20

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
minutes and build this pagination component. So, 

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
start by thinking about the interface of this component, what data

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
does this component need, what are the events it's going to raise? 

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Think about this and then start implementing this component. Now

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
in terms of the UI, this is a bootstrap pagination component, 

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so on bootstrap documentation if you search

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
for pagination, you can see a basic 

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
pagination component, don't worry about the previous and next buttons, 

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
just focus on the page numbers. So this is the mark up

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that you need to return from your pagination component. So go ahead and

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
build this, when you are done, come back and see my solution.
